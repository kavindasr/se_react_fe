The European Parliament’s ordinary legislative procedure has been amended in order to expand its ambits and play a more central role in the implementation of legislation.

Though this does not introduce any new rights into the regime, the codification of the rights has substantially increased the profile of the protected rights8.

The treaty also has endeavoured to successfully streamline the decision-making process within the Council, whereby it has abolished the old system of weighted voting and has replaced it with qualified majority voting for taking important decisions. Finally, the treaty also restates the democratic principles which form the foundation of the EU11.\n            \n            Hence, given the aforementioned points, it can hardly be disputed that the Lisbon Treaty carries significant importance in the constitutional realm of the EU. Since it establishes and regulates the principal organs of the EU, their structure and powers, the treaty is qualified to be christened as the constitution of Europe12.
